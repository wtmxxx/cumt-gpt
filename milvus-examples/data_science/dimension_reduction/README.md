Dimension reduction is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its [intrinsic dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_dimension). Embedding matching in high-dimensional spaces can be undesirable for many reasons; raw data are often [sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) as a consequence of the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), and analyzing the data is usually [computationally intractable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory#Intractability) (hard to control or deal with).

This [notebook](https://github.com/Sharp-rookie/examples/blob/dim_reduct/data_science/dimension_reduction/demo.ipynb) showing you how to use Towhee to reduce the dimension of an embedding space to accelerate the embedding matching.

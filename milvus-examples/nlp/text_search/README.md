# Text Search

Search for text in the text dataset, and it will find the most similar results to the search text across all data. Searching for text is different from traditional keyword searches, which search for semantically relevant content. 



This example will show you how to search article in Medium data  through the [**notebook**](search_article_in_medium.ipynb).

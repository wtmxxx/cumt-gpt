# Text Image Search

Retrieval is the task of finding the most relevant object in a database given a query. In text-image search, we helps you search for matched or related images given an input text.

This text-image search example mainly consists of two notebooks, and I think everyone can learn the basic operations of Towhee and Milvus through the [**getting started notebook**](./1_build_text_image_search_engine.ipynb).

## Learn from Notebook

- [Getting started](./1_build_text_image_search_engine.ipynb)

In this notebook you will get the prerequisites, how to complete a simple text-image search and visualize results,and show you how to start the FastAPI service.

- [Deep dive](./2_deep_dive_text_image_search.ipynb)

In this notebook you will learn how to finetune text-image search on your own dataset and how to deploy a accelerated service for text-image search application.

- [Chinese version](./3_build_chinese_image_search_engine.ipynb)

In this notebook you will learn how to how to build custom towhee ops and complete a simple chinese text-image search and image-image search task.
